# Twitter-Data-Model-Topic-Predictor

We conducted a comprehensive data analysis on three samples of tweets (1k, 10k, 100k) scraped from Twitter, focusing on topic prediction based on tweet text and user description. The first task involved filtering and cleaning the data to retain essential attributes and identifying the top 20 hashtags for each dataset. In the second task, we assigned topics to tweets based on these hashtags, creating a labeled dataset. The third task focused on building and evaluating a machine learning model using Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict tweet topics, achieving a high precision of 0.9675 and recall of 0.98333. Lastly, we performed temporal analysis and queried tweets by date range and country, exporting the results for further insights. Overall, we successfully cleaned, labeled, modeled, and analyzed the tweet datasets, demonstrating robust topic prediction and temporal query capabilities.
